<shortdesc>The <xmlelement>map</xmlelement> element describes the
relationships among a set of resources, such as DITA topics. Maps
consist of references to topics, maps, and other resources organized
into hierarchies, groups, and tables. Maps express these relationships
in a single common format that can be used for different outputs. </shortdesc>

      <title>Usage information</title>
      <p>The containing element for a map is the <xmlelement>map</xmlelement> element. Within the
        map, use the <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> element to add and organize references to the
        topics, and the <xmlelement>topicgroup</xmlelement> and <xmlelement>reltable</xmlelement>
        elements to provide non-hierarchical relationships. You can use the
          <xmlelement>map</xmlelement> element to set default attribute values for all
          <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> elements in the map.</p>
      <p>A map describes the relationships among a set of DITA topics. The following are some
        examples of relationships that can be described in a map:</p>
      <ul id="ul_ujh_mlw_1bb">
        <li>Hierarchical (Parent/Child). Nested topics create a hierarchical relationship. The topic
          that does the nesting is the parent, and the topics that are nested are the children.</li>
        <li>Ordered. Child topics can be labeled as having an ordered relationship, which means they
          are referenced in a definite sequence.</li>
        <li>Family. Child topics can be labeled as having a family relationship, which means they
          all refer to each other.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="processing-expectations">
      <title>Processing expectations</title>
      <p>When rendering a map, processors might make use of these relationships, such as to create a
        Table of Contents (TOC), aggregate topics into a PDF document, or create links between
        topics in output.</p>
      <p>The <xmlelement>title</xmlelement> element <ph>can</ph> optionally be used to provide a
        title for the map (the <xmlelement>title</xmlelement> element is preferred over the
          <xmlatt>title</xmlatt> attribute). In some scenarios the title is purely informational,
        and is present as an aid to the author. In other scenarios it <ph>might</ph> be useful or
        even required. For example, if a map is converted to Eclipse Help, the Eclipse system will
        require a title for the resulting table of contents. In the <xmlelement>bookmap</xmlelement>
        specialization of <xmlelement>map</xmlelement>, the <xmlelement>title</xmlelement> element
        provides a title for the book represented by that map. In a map referenced by another map,
        the <xmlelement>title</xmlelement> might be discarded as topics from the submap are
        aggregated into a larger publication.</p>

<example id="example" otherprops="examples"><title>Example</title><p>In this example, there are six <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> elements. They are nested and
        have a hierarchical relationship. The file <filepath>bats.dita</filepath> is the parent
        topic and the other topics are its children. The hierarchy could be used to generate a PDF,
        a navigation pane in an information center, a summary of the topics, or related links
