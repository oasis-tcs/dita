   <shortdesc>The <xmlelement>exportanchors</xmlelement> element is used to delay
         <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> resolution within DITA documents. This allows you to process or
      display DITA content in a way that will resolve only some of the <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt>
      values in that content, while remaining values are left for later resolution. The element
      contains a list of IDs or keys that are not resolved during the initial preparation of the
      content for display; those IDs and keys will be preserved after that preparation, as will the
      conref relationship itself.</shortdesc>

         <p>The <xmlelement>exportanchors</xmlelement> element can be used within a topic prolog, in
            which case the defined IDs apply to IDs within that topic (excluding sub-topics).
            Alternatively it can be defined in a <xmlelement>topicmeta</xmlelement> element in a
            map. In the second case the IDs apply to the single topic referenced by the current
               <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> element. If the <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement>
            references a file without referencing a specific topic, it is treated as a reference to
            the first or root topic. In order to define anchor ids for a topic that is not the first
            or root topic, a <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> must directly reference the desired
            sub-topic.</p>
         <note>When an element&apos;s ID is defined for delayed resolution, it must contain only the
            element ID, not the usual "topicid/elementid" syntax that is required for most other
            DITA references. The <xref href="anchorid.dita"><xmlelement>anchorid</xmlelement></xref>
            topic explains the format in detail.</note>
         <p>One possible way to use this is with a system that renders DITA dynamically. A user can
            process information locally in a way that resolves <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> for all
            static information, while delaying resolution for information that is subject to change.
            The <xmlelement>exportanchors</xmlelement> element is used to define
               <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> values that are delayed.</p>
         <p>Another potential use is when DITA is used as the source format for a publishing system
            that is able to render information dynamically. In this case some
               <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> values might be resolved, while leaving pre-selected values
            to be resolved live in that publishing system.</p>
