<title>Specialization elements</title>
<shortdesc>Several DITA elements exist either for architectural reasons or for support of
        specialized markup yet to be designed. Although there is little need to use these elements
        unless you are directed to, some of them, such as <xmlelement>state</xmlelement>, can be
        used if your content makes use of these semantic distinctions. For example, a discussion of
        signals on a gate of an integrated logic circuit might use the
            <xmlelement>state</xmlelement> element to represent either on or off conditions of that
        gate.</shortdesc>
