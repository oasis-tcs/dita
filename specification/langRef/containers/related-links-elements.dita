<section id="section-1"><p>Links are different from cross-references. While cross-references occur only within the body of a
    topic and can target any element in the topic or other topics, links only represent
    topic-to-topic connections or connections to non-DITA resources. Links occur after the body of a
    topic, in the <xref keyref="related-links"/> element.</p><p>Links can also be managed indirectly using DITA maps, which provide a more efficient way to
    manage links. Using maps to define links avoids embedded pointers in each topic. This helps keep
    topics free from specific contexts and makes it easier to reuse those topics in new
    locations.</p></section>
