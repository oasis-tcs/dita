<title>Task elements</title>
<shortdesc>Task topics answer "How do I?" questions,
and have a well-defined structure that describes how to complete a procedure
to accomplish a specific goal. Use the task topic to describe the steps of
a particular task, or to provide an overview of a higher-level task. The task
topic includes sections for describing the context, prerequisites, actual
steps, expected results, example, and expected next steps for a task. For
more details on when to use task and other information types, please refer
to the DITA architectural specification.</shortdesc>
