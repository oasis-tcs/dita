  <title>Formatting conventions in the XHTML version of the
	 specification</title> 
  <shortdesc>Given the size and complexity of the specification, it is not
	 generated as a single XHTML file. Instead, each DITA topic is rendered as a
	 separate XHTML file. The XHTML version of the specification uses certain
	 formatting conventions to aid readers in navigating through the specification
	 and locating material easily: Link previews and navigation links.

		<title>Link previews</title> 
		<p>The DITA specification uses the content of the DITA
		  <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> element to provide link previews for its
		  readers. These link previews are visually highlighted by a border and a colored
		  background. The link previews are not normative; they contain the content of
		  the <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> element for the child topic, which is
		  rendered in a normative context as the first paragraph of the topic; the
		  content is identical in both renditions. The link previews serve as enhanced
		  navigation aids, enabling readers to more easily locate content. This usability
		  enhancement is one of the ways in which the specification illustrates the
		  capabilities of DITA and exemplifies DITA best practices. 
		</p> 
		<p>The following screen capture illustrates how link previews are
		  displayed in the XHTML version of the specification:

		<title>Navigation links</title> 
		<p>To ease readers in navigating from one topic to another, each XHTML
		  file generated by a DITA topic contains the following navigation links at the
