			 <alt >Block diagram illustrating the components
				of the three editions of the DITA specification, and the subset relationships
				between the three editions. The Base Edition ('Part 1') contains the Base
				Architecture, which includes map, topic, and subject scheme. The Technical
				Content Edition ('Part 2') contains the Base Architecture plus the Technical
				Content specializations, which include concept, task, reference, book map,
				glossary, classification map, machine industry, and troubleshooting. The
				All-Inclusive Edition ('Part 3') contains the Base Architecture, the Technical
				Content specializations, and the Learning and Training specializations.
				Portions of this diagram specific to the All-Inclusive Edition are highlighted
				and bold, while others are dimmed, to signify that this is the All-Inclusive
				Edition of the specification.
