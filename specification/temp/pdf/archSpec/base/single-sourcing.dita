  <p class="- topic/p " xtrc="p:1;20:6" xtrf="file:/C:/Git/dita/specification/archSpec/base/single-sourcing.dita">Like many XML-based applications for human-readable documentation, DITA supports the separation
   of content from presentation. This is necessary when content is used in different contexts, since
   authors cannot predict how or where the material that they author will be used. The following
   features and mechanisms enable users to produce different deliverable formats from a
   single source:<dl class="- topic/dl " xtrc="dl:1;24:22" xtrf="file:/C:/Git/dita/specification/archSpec/base/single-sourcing.dita">

      can provide appropriate rendition distinctions. Because the use of specializations does not
      impede interchange or interoperability, DITA users can safely create the specializations that
      are demanded by their local delivery and rendition requirements, with a minimum of additional
      impact on the systems and business processes that depend on or use the content. While general
      XML practices suggest that element types should be semantic, specialization can be used to
      define element types that are purely presentational in nature. The highlighting domain is an
      example of such a specialization.</dd>
