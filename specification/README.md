# The OASIS DITA 1.3 Errata 01 specification is delivered in four parts. 

Each part is built from DITA source, with content reused across the parts.
DITAVAL documents are used to conditionally process each map in order to generate
the final specification. This document describes which map and which DITAVAL
document is used to generate the parts.

## Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) Part 0: Overview Plus Errata 01.

Part 0 is built using the following root map: 
`dita-1.3-specification-overview.ditamap`

Part 0 is built using the following DITAVAL document: 
`resources/DITA1.3-spec-overview.ditaval`

## Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) Part 1: Base Edition Plus Errata 01. 

This edition contains topic and map; it is designed for implementers and users who need only the most fundamental pieces of the DITA framework.

Part 1 is built using the following root map: 
`dita-1.3-specification-base.ditamap`

Part 1 is built using the following DITAVAL document: 
`resources/DITA1.3-spec-base.ditaval`

## Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) Part 2: Technical Content Edition Plus Errata 01. 

This edition contains the base architecture plus the technical-content specializations; it is designed for authors who use information typing and document complex applications and devices.

Part 2 is built using the following root map: 
`dita-1.3-specification-technicalContent.ditamap`

Part 2 is built using the following DITAVAL document: 
`resources/DITA1.3-spec-technicalContent.ditaval`


## Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) Part 3: All-Inclusive Edition Plus Errata 01.

This edition contains the base architecture, technical content, and the learning and training specializations. It is designed for implementers who want all OASIS-approved specializations, as well as users who develop learning and training materials.

Part 3 is built using the following root map: 
`dita-1.3-specification-learningTraining.ditamap`

Part 3 is built using the following DITAVAL document: 
`resources/DITA1.3-spec-learningTraining.ditaval`
