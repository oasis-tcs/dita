   <title>Using the <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attribute</title>
   <shortdesc>The specification defines tokens for the <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attribute that cover
      the most common chunking scenarios. These tokens <ph >can</ph> be used to
      override whatever default chunking behavior is set by a processor. Chunking is necessarily
      format specific, with chunked output required for some and not supported for other rendered
      formats. Chunking is also implementation specific with some implementations supporting some,
      but not all, chunking methods, or adding new methods to the standard ones described in this
      specification. </shortdesc>
   <conbody>
      <section id="section1"><p>The value of the <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attribute consists of one or
            more space delimited tokens. Tokens are defined in three categories: for selecting
            topics, for setting chunking policies, and for defining how the chunk values impact
            rendering. It is an error to use two tokens from the same category on a single
               <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> element.</p><dl>

               <dd>When addressing a document that contains multiple topics, these values determine
                  which topics are selected. These values are ignored when the element on which they
                  are specified does not reference a topic. The defined values are:<ul

                        releases, the "to-navigation" token indicates that a new chunk of navigation
                        should be used to render the current selection (such as an individual Table
                        of Contents or related links). When specified on the

            passed to its children. A default by-xxx policy for an entire map <ph

            attribute on the <xmlelement>map</xmlelement> element, which will apply to any

            are not desired, a default for a specific map can be established by including a
               <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attribute value on the <xmlelement>map</xmlelement> element.
