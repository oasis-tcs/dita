 <title>DITA markup </title>
 <shortdesc>Topics and maps are the basic building blocks of the Darwin Information Typing
  Architecture (DITA). Metadata attributes and values can be added to DITA topics and maps, as well
  as to elements within topics, to allow for conditional publishing and content reuse. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>DITA topics and maps are XML documents that conform to the XML specification. As such, they can
   be viewed, edited, validated, and processed with standard XML tools, although some DITA-specific
   features, such as content reference, key reference, and specialization require DITA-specific
   processing for full implementation and validation.</p>

   <p>This section of the spec now only contain normative content. Other material has been moved
    into the "Overview of DITA" section.</p>
   <!--IGNORE may-must-should word-->
   <p>This is not the final location for this content, nor is the umbrella title of "DITA markup"
    the correct title. Thoughts on where this content should go very welcome ...</p>
