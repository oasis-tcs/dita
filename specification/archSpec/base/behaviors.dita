    <title>DITA processing</title>
    <shortdesc>DITA processing is affected by a number of factors, including attributes that
        indicate the set of vocabulary and constraint modules on which a DITA document depends;
        navigation; linking; content reuse (using direct or indirect addressing); conditional
        processing; branch filtering; chunking; and more. In addition, translation of DITA content
        is expedited through the use of the <xmlatt>dir</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>translate</xmlatt>, and
            <xmlatt>xml:lang</xmlatt> attributes.</shortdesc>
