 <title>Extending subject schemes</title>
 <shortdesc>The <xmlelement>schemeref</xmlelement> element provides a mechanism for extending a
  subject scheme. This makes it possible to add new relationships to existing subjects and extend
  enumerations of controlled values.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The <xmlelement>schemeref</xmlelement> element provides a reference to another subject scheme
   map. Typically, the referenced subject-scheme map defines a base set of controlled values that
   are extended by the current subject-scheme map. The values in the referenced subject-scheme map
   are merged with the values in the current subject-scheme map; the result is equivalent to
   specifying all of the values in a single subject scheme map.</p>
  <!--<draft-comment author="Kristen Eberlein" time="5 February 2015"><p>I added this topic to address comments made by Chris Nitchie in the targeted review. FYI, the paragraph above was in the DITA 1.2 Language Reference topic about <xmlelement>schemeref</xmlelement>.</p><p>Re <xref href="example-subjectScheme-extension.dita"/>, Chris stated "That's not how keyref normally works. We definitely need normative language describing the expected processing of keyref in the context of a subject scheme. It's completely different from normal keyref behavior. Normally, a keyref is a reference to the content referenced by the key-defining topicref, not a reference to the topicref itself. And there's no transclusion or extension, as is implied here. So it's completely different processing rules for keys in a subject scheme, and it needs normative description."</p><p>Re <xref href="example-subjectScheme-extension-upwards.dita"/>, Chris stated " ... the use of keyref in subject schemes to recombine subject definitions is never covered anywhere."</p><p>I suspect that we need additional normative content in this topic ...</p></draft-comment>-->
