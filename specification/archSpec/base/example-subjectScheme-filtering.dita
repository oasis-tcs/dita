  <example id="example" otherprops="examples">
   <p>A company defines a subject category for "Operating system", with a key set to "os". There are
    sub-categories for Linux, Windows, and z/OS, as well as specific Linux variants: Red Hat Linux
    and SuSE Linux. The company then binds the values that are enumerated in the "Operating system"
    category to the <xmlatt>platform</xmlatt> attribute.</p>
            <codeblock conref="../../common/conref-code-samples.dita#reuse-code-samples/basic-subjectScheme"/>
   <p>The enumeration limits valid values for the <xmlatt>platform</xmlatt> attribute to the
    following: "linux", "redhat", "suse", "windows", and "zos". If any other values are encountered,
    processors validating against the scheme should issue a warning.</p>
   <!--<p>As a result, the values could be used in this way:<codeblock>&lt;p platform="linux">You must set up a cron job to ...&lt;/p>
&lt;p platform="redhat">To set up the cron job, ...&lt;/p></codeblock></p>-->
   <p>The following table illustrates how filtering and flagging operate when the above map is
    processed by a processor. The first two columns provide the values specified in the DITAVAL
    file; the third and fourth columns indicate the results of the filtering or flagging
     operation<table colsep="1" rowsep="1">

  <!--<p>This hierarchical enumeration affects filtering and flagging as
follows:<ul>
<li>    When filtering includes or excludes Linux explicitly and doesn't
identify RedHat explicitly, processes should also apply the filtering
operation to the RedHat content because RedHat is a special kind of
Linux.</li>
<li>When filtering includes RedHat explicitly and doesn't explicitly
exclude Linux, processes should include the general Linux content
because the general Linux content applies to RedHat Linux.</li>
<li>When filtering excludes RedHat explicitly and doesn't explicitly
include or exclude Linux, processes should include the general Linux
content because the exclusion doesn't necessarily apply to other kinds
of Linux.</li>
<li>When flagging is set explicitly for Linux but isn't set explicitly
for RedHat, processes should also apply the Linux flag to the RedHat
content because RedHat is a special kind of Linux.</li>
</ul></p>-->
