  <title>Conformance of document-type shells</title>
  <shortdesc>DITA documents typically are governed by a conforming DITA document-type shell.
    However, the conformance of a DITA document is a function of the document instance, not its
    governing grammar. Conforming DITA documents are not required to use a conforming document-type
    shell.</shortdesc>

    <p>Conforming DITA documents are not required to have any governing <ph
        rev="review-p">document-type</ph> declaration or schema. There
      might be compelling or practical reasons to use non-conforming
      document-type shells. For example, a document might use a
      document-type shell that does not conform to the DITA requirements
      for shells in order to meet the needs of a specific application or
      tool. Such a non-conforming document-type shell still might enable
      the creation of conforming DITA content.</p>
