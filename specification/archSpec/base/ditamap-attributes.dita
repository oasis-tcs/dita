  <shortdesc>DITA maps have unique attributes that are designed to control the
	 way that relationships are interpreted for different output purposes. In
	 addition, DITA maps share many metadata and linking attributes with DITA

      attributes in this topic that are more comprehensively defined in the

      differently and ideally reuse definitions.<div>
        <p>Kris Eberlein, 28 September 2022</p>
        <p>I alphabeticized the attributes in this topic. I also added them
          to draft comments in the definitions in the "Attributes" topics,
          so that we could consider them side-by-side.</p>

			<p>DITA maps often encode structures that are specific to a particular medium or output, for
				example, Web pages or a PDF document. Attributes, such as
					<xmlatt>deliveryTarget</xmlatt> and <xmlatt>toc</xmlatt>, are designed to help
				processors interpret the DITA map for each kind of output.</p>

			<p>Many of the following attributes are not available in DITA topics; individual topics,

					<dd>The <xmlatt>collection-type</xmlatt> attribute specifies how the children of a

						each other. This attribute, which is set on the parent element, typically is
						used by processors to determine how to generate navigation links in the
						rendered topics. For example, a <xmlatt>collection-type</xmlatt> value of
						"sequence" indicates that children of the specifying
							<xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> element represent an ordered sequence
						of topics; processors might add numbers to the list of child topics or
						generate next/previous links for online presentation. This attribute is
						available in topics on the <xmlelement>linklist</xmlelement> and
							<xmlelement>linkpool</xmlelement> elements, where it has the same
						behavior. Where the <xmlatt>collection-type</xmlatt> attribute is available

						<p>By default, the relationships between the topics that are referenced in a
							map are reciprocal:</p>
						<ul>

							<li>Next and previous topics in a sequence link to each other. </li>
							<li>Topics in a family link to their sibling topics. </li>
							<li>Topics referenced in the table cells of the same row in a
								relationship table link to each other. A topic referenced within a
								table cell does not (by default) link to other topics referenced in
								the same table cell. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>This behavior can be modified by using the <xmlatt>linking</xmlatt> attribute, which
							enables an author or information architect to specify how a topic
							participates in a relationship. The following values are valid:</p>
						<dl>
							<dlentry>
								<dt><codeph>linking="none"</codeph>
								</dt>
								<dd>Specifies that the topic does not exist in the map for the
									purposes of calculating links. </dd>
							</dlentry>
							<dlentry>
								<dt><codeph>linking="sourceonly"</codeph>
								</dt>
								<dd>Specifies that the topic will link to its related topics but not
									vice versa. </dd>
							</dlentry>
							<dlentry>
								<dt><codeph>linking="targetonly"</codeph>

									versa. </dd>
							</dlentry>
							<dlentry>
								<dt><codeph>linking="normal"</codeph>
								</dt>
								<dd>Default value. It specifies that linking will be reciprocal (the
									topic will link to related topics, and they will link back to
									it). </dd>
							</dlentry>
						</dl>
						<p>Authors also can create links directly in a topic by using the
								<xmlelement>xref</xmlelement> or <xmlelement>link</xmlelement>
							elements, but in most cases map-based linking is preferable, because
							links in topics create dependencies between topics that can hinder
							reuse. </p>
						<p>Note that while the relationships between the topics that are referenced
							in a map are reciprocal, the relationships merely <i>imply</i>
							reciprocal links in generated output that includes links. The rendered
							navigation links are a function of the presentation style that is
							determined by the processor. </p>
